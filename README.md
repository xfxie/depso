DEPSO
========

DEPSO, or called DEPS, is an optimization algorithm hybridizing the advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). It can be incorporated into [cooperative group optimization](http://www.wiomax.com/optimization) (CGO) system.

The [DEPSO paper](http://www.wiomax.com/team/xie/paper/SMCC03.pdf) has been [cited](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=%22DEPSO%3A+hybrid+particle+swarm+with+differential+evolution+operator%22) over 500 times with various applications. DEPSO was also implemented (by Sun Microsystems Inc.) into [NLPSolver](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/NLPSolver) (Solver for Nonlinear Programming), an extension of Calc in Apache OpenOffice.

Problem to be Solved
--------------------
It solves (constrained) numerical optimization problem (NOP) as

where f(x) is the objective function and each g(x) is a constraint function to be satisfied, and _c_ and _d_ are constants. All the functions can be nonlinear and nonsmooth.
